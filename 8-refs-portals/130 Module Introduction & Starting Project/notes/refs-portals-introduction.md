# Refs & Portals

In this section, we will be learning about Refs & Portals, and by the end, we will know how to:

- Access DOM elements with refs
- Manage values with refs (and know which values should be managed by refs and which values should be managed by state)
- Expose API functions from components
- Detach DOM rendering from the JSX structure with portals
