# Working with Props

Your task is to make the `CourseGoal` component reusable and configurable. It should accept a "title" and a "description" input and output the received data between the `<h2>` (title) and `<p>` (description) tags.

The `App` component should then render at least two instances of the `CourseGoal` component.

One of those `CourseGoal` components must receive a title of "Learn React" and a description of "In-depth". The other titles and descriptions are entirely up to you.
