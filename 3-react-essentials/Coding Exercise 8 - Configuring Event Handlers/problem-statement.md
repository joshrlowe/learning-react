# Configuring Event Handlers

Your task is to edit the `<button>` in the `App` component such that the already defined `handleCreateUser` function is called with a value for `name`.

You must not hard-code the value that should be assigned to `user.name` in the `handleCreateUser` function but instead pass it as a value for the `name` parameter when a click event on the `<button>` occurs.
