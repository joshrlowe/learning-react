# Conditional Content

You're working on a part of a web app responsible for showing a warning when a user is about to perform a dangerous action. Your task is to conditionally show a warning box once a user has clicked a specific button. Inside that warning dialog, another button allows users to dismiss the warning (i.e., remove the warning box from the screen).
