# Building & Using a Component

Your task is to create a new `MainGoal` component which outputs a paragraph of text that describes your main course goal (e.g., "My main goal: Learn React in-depth and from the ground up").

You'll have to create this new component from scratch and then use it inside the `App` component's JSX code.

**Important:** To ensure that the automatic checks correctly detect your solution, your component must be called `MainGoal` and it also must be exported. To do that, simply add the `export` keyword in front of your `MainGoal` component.

The `MainGoal` component also must contain the text "My main goal:" (followed by whatever your main course goal is).
