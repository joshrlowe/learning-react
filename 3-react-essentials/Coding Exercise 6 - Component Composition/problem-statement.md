# Component Composition

Your task is to create a reusable `Card` component that takes a `name` prop as an input and, in addition, can be wrapped around any JSX code.

Use the already existing `Card.js` file to create the `Card` component in there. You can add the `card` CSS class to the main wrapping element in that component for some styling.

The `name` prop should be output as a title inside the `Card` component, and the wrapped JSX code should be output below that title.
