# Component Composition as a Solution to Prop Drilling

Component composition is a solution that works in certain scenarios for prop drilling.

## What is Component Composition?

Component composition refers to the practice of assembling complex components from simpler ones. Instead of passing props through multiple layers of nested components (known as prop drilling), you can create components that encapsulate functionality and pass data directly where it's needed. This reduces the depth of component nesting and makes the code more manageable.

However, while component composition can help alleviate the issues caused by prop drilling, it isn't a universal solution. Overusing it can lead to a bloated `App` component, as too many responsibilities are handled at the top level.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused in other parts of the application.
- **Scalability:** This approach makes it easier to manage and scale the application as it grows, by adding more components or enhancing existing ones without cluttering a single file.

## Why Not Always Use It

- Overusing composition without proper state management can lead to complex and tightly coupled components, especially when managing global states.
- It's essential to balance component composition with other state management solutions like the Context API or state management libraries (e.g., Redux) to keep the application scalable and maintainable, which we will examine.
