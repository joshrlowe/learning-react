# The Context API

React's Context API is a built-in feature that simplifies sharing data across components and layers in an application.

**Key Points:**

- **Context Creation:** Create a context value using `React.createContext()`.
- **Context Provider:** Wrap the provider component around parts of the application that need the context value. For global access, wrap it around the entire application.
- **State Connection:** Connect state to this context, eliminating the need for prop drilling.
- **Component Access:** Components that need the context value can directly access it, making state management more efficient.

This powerful solution will be explored in more detail going forward.
